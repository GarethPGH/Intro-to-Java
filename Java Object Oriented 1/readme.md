A collection of assignments from the Object Oriented Java 1 class
<br>
### First Assignment: 
Should have been labelled "Converting Currencies"<br>
Converts various currencies to and from US dollars. Uses the JOptionPane class to produce an interactive menu. A user can switch back and forth between converting to or from USD. Currency symbols are shown in the output. Execution continues until the user picks Quit, or closes the window.
A previous version of the Converting Currencies class, Convert Money is included, where I used a generic method to convert to or from the list of currencies, using parallel arrays as information storage, where the indicies matched each specific currency. The teacher did not want a generic method and preferred to have methods for each individual currency.

### Inventory Management System
Swing GUI program
Allows a user to imput details about a list of inventory products.<br>
Keeps a running talley of the value of the total inventory, and how many different products are in a simulated "warehouse", as well as shows the quantity of the product on hand, on order, sold, value of the total of each product, and price of the product.
A list of products is produced from the user input

### Tuition Management System
Swing GUI program used to test understanding of Inheritence.<br>
Calculates the various fees, and tuition cost of a student who is part time or full time, based on specific values.
A separate list of students is produced, where the user can view individual data about each student.
GUI class features some validation methods that should be extracted into their own class, but I had run out of time to do so before submission.
Future version would include the ability to filter the list based on whether students are full time, part time, county, out of county, or out of state residents. Built on top of that, database, or permanent storage such as writing files should be used.
